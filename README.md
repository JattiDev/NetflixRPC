### How to install?
First you need to download it from releases page from here you'll get two files: NetflixRPC.jar and NetflixRPC.crx.
Now create new folder in which you'll unzip that .crx file and go to your Google Chrome to `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mod then click option Load Unpacked Extension and then go to folder when you unzipped that .crx file and click OK, great, now you have extension installed. To use .jar file just put it in some folder and then go to cmd and in it go to that folder and type `java -jar NetflixRPC.jar`, when it will enable, go to Netflix and start using this RPC!
